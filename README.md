# Wordcloud Generator for texts in English and Portuguese

### This Project is finished, for test it you have to download the folder of this repository and execute the command ‘Python app.py” in your command prompt on the directory of the app. 

In this Project we aimed to make a simple but usable app to generate wordclouds from texts in both languages, Portuguese and English to provide us insights by a visual analysis of the most frequent words in the texts you want to analyze. 

The whole part of generate the wordcloud was performed in the class ‘biblioteca1.py’ Where the text and its language is given and has some words removed according to the language, which these words are called ‘stopwords’ that are words with no significant meaning to allow us to have some insight about the text by looking for them.
