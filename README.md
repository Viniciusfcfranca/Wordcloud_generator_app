# Wordcloud_generator_app
In this repository you're going to have access to the notebooks used to develop an app that generates worclouds since the texts inputed are in english or portuguese


Introduction
Wordclouds are graps that show us the most frequent words in a text what can give us a bunch of insights about the text, so with this motivation, this app aims to give us a simple
but valuable tool to have simple wordclouds about all texts we want since they'd been written in english or portuguese. Other languages aren't going to work in this app.

Instructions
At first, you have to provide your text to the app in the space given to type the text, after that you're going to type the language of the text in the box to set the language,
next you'll click in the box called "Generate wordcloud" so your wordcloud will be generated based on the words present in your text and wait the page load, so than you click 
in the box "click to see result" after the wordcloud be generated to your wordcloud appear in your screen.
